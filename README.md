# tinboxbakeshop.com [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tinboxbakeshop/tinboxbakeshop.github.io.svg?branch=source)](https://travis-ci.org/tinboxbakeshop/tinboxbakeshop.github.io)

[tinboxbakeshop.com](tinboxbakeshop.com) site

*UPDATE!*

The website has now been converted to a Jekyll generated site with templates. Commits to this source branch will now trigger a build and deploy upon successful build.

## Structure

This website follows a standard Jekyll site pattern with the only exceptions that we are not using the ```_posts``` or ```_data``` folders.

The main layout is under ```_layouts/default.html``` and includes ```_includes/head.html``` ```_includes/footer.html``` ```_includes/welcome.html``` ```_includes/updates.html```

CSS for this is done in SASS/SCSS and in the ```_sass``` folder for easier read and updates.
